# üå´Ô∏è Beijing PM2.5 Air Quality Prediction App

**Predict PM2.5 pollution levels in Beijing using machine learning and meteorological data.**

This **web application** allows users to **predict the concentration** of **PM2.5 particulate matter in Beijing's air** based on **weather conditions** and **historical pollution data**. Built with `Streamlit` and a **pre-trained machine learning model**, it provides **real-time, interactive forecasts** with intuitive color-coded results indicating **air quality levels**.

## üìåFeatures
- Input precise **date** and **time **for accurate timestamping of predictions
- Enter **meteorological parameters**: temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction & speed, solar radiation
- Include **historical PM2.5 measurements** (lag features and moving averages)
- **Dynamic prediction** with clear, color-coded air quality levels and health advice
- Expandable sections with **detailed input parameters** and **app info**
- Responsive, user-friendly interface with custom styling and helpful tooltips
